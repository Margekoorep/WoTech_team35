## **Team Introtuctions:**

**Marge (team lead):** 
Hi! I'm Marge from Estonia. Now I can already say I had (as to 'I have') no previous experience with coding. I applied to WoTech program to gain a knowledge in coding on witch I can start building my career in coding. 

Right now I am working as a midwife in one of the Estonia's biggest maternity Hospital and women's health clinic. 

As a moral support I have my cat Nala who is always ready to give me a play breaks when thing get tough and my brain needs a break. 

This time I chose (and everybody agreed - democracy) to be the team lead. It will be a new challenge and with it I will push myself to do thing out of my comfort zone.
